Forest Quest Game
Overview
Forest Quest Game is an interactive text-based adventure where the player embarks on a journey to retrieve a legendary crystal from a dangerous and enchanted forest. The game involves navigating through various obstacles, defeating enemies, collecting rewards, and strategizing to find the shortest path to the crystal.

Features
AVL Tree Implementation:

Store player's inventory of item scores.
Add and remove item scores based on rewards.
Each reward has a generated id and a reward score.
Pathfinding Algorithms:

Floyd's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between any two areas in the forest.
Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the forest.
Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the forest.
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the player's current location to the crystal.
Game Map Details:

Map symbols include clear paths, obstacles, rewards (jewels, potions, weapons), enemies (werewolves, goblins, dragons), death points, and the crystal goal point.
How to Play
Compile and run the C++ program.
Use the menu options to:
View the shortest path using default or custom locations.
Calculate the minimum spanning tree using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
Navigate through the forest, collecting rewards, defeating enemies, and avoiding obstacles.
Reach the crystal goal point while maximizing your score and minimizing losses.
Restrictions
The program is written in C++ without using pre-built libraries or APIs.
Documentation is provided within the code to facilitate understanding and modification.
Future Improvements
Implement graphical interface for better user experience.
Add more diverse obstacles, enemies, and rewards to enhance gameplay.
Incorporate additional pathfinding algorithms for comparison and optimization.
